  - Fix to DeploymentHandler following upstream changes.

0.041     2019-03-13 12:05:31+00:00 Europe/London

  - Hive changes:
    - The Hive is now implemeted as a singleton object. This means you can
      construct your own Hive if you want.
    - Changes to this object are implemented as transformations on it, following
      the immutability principles of functional programming.
    - The Hive now throws proper exceptions (see p3rl.org/failures) instead of
      dumb strings.
    - The Hive now has an init method, to which configuration is passed. This
      will throw an exception as early as possible if the requested
      configuration cannot be satisfied. See perldoc for more on this.
    - Configuration now parses __ENV(XYZ)__ tokens, like Catalyst's own config.
    - Services are no longer selected automatically; the Hive must be told
      explicitly which Brain provides which service.
    - Brains will no longer register themselves by default.
    - The FB11AuthDB brain is no longer auto-registered. Apps should register it
      in config.
    - Audit Trail and SysParams brains still register themselves but will stop
      doing so in the near future.
    - An *experimental* Auth hat role has been created, to attempt to define an
      interface for authentication hats. This should not be considered generally
      usable.
    - Lots of documentation fixes - patches still welcome.
  - Docker changes:
    - Base docker image has been replaced, so many things have been removed from
      our own Dockerfile.
    - Dockerfile leaves us as root; the entrypoint now uses gosu to run commands
      as fb11. This means that derived images still have root for their own
      entrypoints. It also means that if you provide a command to the
      entrypoint, you have to use gosu yourself or drop user first.
    - Improved error reporting when the entrypoint doesn't know what to do.
    - If you give the entrypoint a command to run, it will be run in the
      environment implied by the FB11_APP environment variable, i.e. the same
      environment as the app itself.
    - Default environment in the apps.yml will now replace empty variables as
      well as unset (false ones as opposed to only undefined ones).
  - Test changes:
    - All the tests have been deleted except for the Hive tests, which are the
      only ones that still worked.
  - Styling changes:
    - The Help and Favourite buttons have been removed because they don't work.
    - The Notifications side card has been removed because we don't have
      notifications yet.
    - App templates are now discovered before FB11 base templates.
    - Non-alnum characters in menu names no longer cause the menu to fail to
      activate.
    - Various fixes to determining whether a user can access a link.
      - Gear icon access is now actually tested.
  - Miscellaneous changes:
    - Users will no longer fall into the purgatory of being "active". They are
      either "enabled" or "disabled".
    - Controllers can now define ACL rules as part of their configuration, on
      top of the existing method of using :FB11Feature attributes on their
      paths.
    - The fb11-dbh script now has a -E flag, which will take connection
      parameters from the environment. See perldoc.
    - FB11 auth config no longer clobbers app-specific auth config.

  - Reverted changes to User model that caused issues
  - Users can no longer be deleted; instead they can be activated and
    deactivated. This prevents crashes caused when FB11X modules restrict user
    deletion because they have used the user ID to audit things
  - The shown-with JavaScript now supports negations on the comparator:
        class="shown-with" rel="[name=some-field]@~notthisvalue"
